This is a simple web application which registers members in the monthly organized Yoga Classes.

Only people within the age limit of 18-65 can enroll for the monthly classes and they will be paying the fees on a month on month basis. 
They can enroll any day but they will have to pay for the entire month. The monthly fee is 500/- Rs INR.
There are a total of 4 batches a day namely 6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM and 5-6PM. The participants can choose any batch in a month and can move to any other batch next month.

While preparing this project, a few assumptions were made which are as follows.


1. A single member can register only once using their phone number.
2. A user can change the slot alloted to them for the next month, multiple times.
3. A new member must register into the system for the first time only.
4. In subsequent visits, they can use the login functionality to see and modify their details.
5. Currently, the pay fees button is disabled.
